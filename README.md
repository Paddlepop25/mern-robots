## Story time

Having started to learn and utilize React at work, I've always wanted to create a fullstack end-to-end MERN project so as to understand the whole flow better.

The project I have in mind is a music guessing game, but this is a start.

There were some errors especially with typescript incorporated and time was spent to recity the bugs 🐛🕷️🦟🐜. It was worth the effort as I learnt alot along the way and added some useful links in the resources sections.

As this is an ongoing project, I have included some work-in-progress notes at the bottom as a reminder of the various tasks.

I want to thank Nadun De Silva for his encouragement to get this ROBOT 🤖 going. He has this awesome Snake & Ladders game in the appstore. Please download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enadun.snakes.and.ladders).

## UI/UX

Going for a simple light theme. Chose a pinkish theme color to contrast the loud, vibrant colors of the robots.

As much as possible, I added media queries to make the pages responsive to medium and small devices.
